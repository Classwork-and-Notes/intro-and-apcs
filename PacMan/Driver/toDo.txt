To Do: MUST HAVE

1. move(); PacMan moves along the a path pixel by pixel FACING THE RIGHT DIRECTIOn!     ¡Ì
2. Ghost class; Four ghosts that move (bare minimum)
3. super pellet implementation; Once PacMan eats a Super Pellet, he Ghosts should turn blue and move slower
4. points; Point allocation for eating pellets and ghosts - use dossier for reference
5. lives; when PacMan dies, as long as there are still lives left, restart at starting position with SAME NUMBER OF PELLETS 
6. opening/death sequence; death animation, and the ready screen with optional music

EXTRA, BUT HIGHLY PREFERABLE

7. Personalized ghosts; program the personalities
8. Ghost movement stages: scatter, chase, frightened - use dossier for reference
9. Ghost eaten animation; When super pellet mode is activated, ghosts that are eaten have a return animation
10. SPEED; instead of levels, increase difficulty by increasing speed a bit for the next level
11. Fruit; extra points

IF WE HAVE TIME (hahaha)

12. Cool outfits for pacman ( I propose sunglasses )
