Brainstormed:
survey form that appends to a .csv that is also linked so people can see responses
encrypter supporting rotx and rev in ord and chr form with cases and accompanying decrypter
a page linking to pages that will have mathematical formulas using QUERY_STRING or interactive spaces that will solve various math problems (trig fns, quadratics, dims, measures of central tendency & dispersion, summations, nth terms of series)

Brainstormed:
Something that accepts queries in the url is the simplest to approach, as it will not require any JS for user input
The only idea that incorporates this is the problem solver
On the other hand, something like a text box is much more user friendly
If we can easily slip in code to allow a text box and send that data to the python script, that would be preferable
It all depends on learning how to make interactive objects show up on the page and send data back to our code

chat board with anonymous posting (no need to hold account info). Each post could go into a subset of posts all in one group. Each post can be commented on.

The chat board looks best right now. It can be easily separated into different catergories with different focuses (and seperate structures)
Everything will be simpler if we force anonymity on all posters.
Allow for posted links to show up as hyperlinks
Look at the DD poster on minutia for guidance
Moderation of boards will be by the hoster. Because we are staying away from account storage, an email will be availabe on the site for complaints. The host can then just delete entries deemed inappropriate.

Wrote function for creating a account locally given preset variables. Checks if commas presents in credentials when creating account to avoid future issues with data splitting. Creates a list of existing usernames, and checks if the username is in the list of existing usernames. If not then add the username/password pair to the csv file.
